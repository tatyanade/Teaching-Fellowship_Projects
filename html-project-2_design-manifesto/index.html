                            Generally, the best rule of thumb is to stick with one font for your titles and headers, like a serif font or a display font, and another font for the rest of your text, such as paragraphs or subtitles.

                Whitespace and heirarchy go hand in hand. You can see examples of good and bad whitespace in the examples in the hierarchy section, but let's talk more about it.

                    <div class="col-12">
                        Good white space is a lot of whitespace. This helps us emphasize what is important. Most of this page is empty space, that lets us focus on the text that we want people to see.

                            <br> But since they all look the same, we dont know which is more important.
                            <br> Is it this one?
                            <br> No.. I dont think it was.
                            <br> Maybe this line here is more important, after all it is longer than all of the others?
                            <br> But I still can't tell!

                            Everyone loves colors, because they make things look more colorful! When designing websites, our color palettes can help us establish a brand identity (along with our font and layouts.

                        <h3 id="colorGradient">So instead of making something like this, we should use colors that fit together and add to the theme of our website.</h3>

                        <p>
                            There are many of ways to use color tastefully! Even with a background color!

                        <br>
                        <p>In this example I'm using a light blue background, then a dark blue for my header. As you can see the colors are a complementary color scheme, and are not distracting. Instead they harmonize with eachother and look calming together.</p>

                            I can even use horizontal lines of a slightly contrasting color to make a nice but subtle distinction between chunks of content, like this!

                            And I can even use it to create the bottom of my page

            <h2>Image Irritation</h2>

            <p>
                Images can add a lot to your page! After all, an image <i>is</i> worth one thousand words. Here are some guidelines:
            </p>

            <div class="container">
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>
                            It can look jarring to have lots of images of different weights and heights.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <img src="images/small/1.png" height="120">
                        <img src="images/small/2.png">
                        <img src="images/small/3.png">
                        <img src="images/small/4.png" height="70">
                        <img src="images/small/5.png">
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p> This looks bad! It is better to keep all of the heights the same if we are storing images in a row (like google images), or to keep the widths the same if we are storing in columns (like pinterest).</p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-12">
                        <p>
                            When using images, we want to make sure our image quality is proportional to the size we display it as. Observe the difference between small images made bigger, and bigger images made smaller.
                        </p>
                    </div>
                </div>
                <div class="row">
                    <div class="col-6">
