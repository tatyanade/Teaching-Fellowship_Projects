      Paying attention to font choice is extremely important!

            <p id="goodFonts2">
              Generally, the best rule of thumb is to stick with one font for your titles and headers, like a serif font or a display font, and another font for the rest of your text, such as paragraphs or subtitles.

    <h2>Heirarchy Hijinks</h2>
    <p>When writing content for a website, it can be easy to write every single thought you have and throw it onto a page. However, we want to pay special attention to how our content is placed on the screen.</p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>

      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6">
          <p id="badText1">
            If I have a lot of text on the page, without any heirarchy or division of content, or without any labelling, or without any visual differentiation, such as size, color, weight, or font, or a lot of content contained in extremely long run-on sentances, the important parts of what I am trying to say might get lost in the ocean of text that I am presenting to the viewer, and they may miss a lot of what I want to show them, especially the important parts, because they are jumbled into an unclimbable wall of text that becomes imposing and unreadable and absolutely prevents any sort of meaning or wisdom to be discerned from it, regardless of how much I, the writer of all the content, desprately wishes that the reader of my webpage, in this case you, would go through all my words, memorize them by heart, and accept them willingly into their mental lexicon of design principles.

             The most important elements of web design are:

          <li>Whitespace and Heirarchy</li>
          <li>Fonts and Text</li>

    <h2>Whitespace Waggishness</h2>
    <p>
      Whitespace and heirarchy go hand in hand. You can see examples of good and bad whitespace in the examples in the hierarchy section, but let's talk more about it.
    </p>
    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          Good white space is a lot of whitespace. This helps us emphasize what is important. Most of this page is empty space, that lets us focus on the text that we want people to see.
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-6" id="badWhitespace">
          <p id="badWhitespace
          ">
            Here are a  lot of different lines of text.
            <br>
            But since they all look the same, we dont know which is more important.
            <br>
            Is it this one?
            <br>
            No.. I dont think it was.
            <br>
            Maybe this line here is more important, after all it is longer than all of the others?
            <br>
            But I still can't tell!
            <br>
            If only there was an easier way.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-6">
          <h3>This is important, so it's BIG</h3>
          <h5 id="goodWhitespaceh5">This is important but also related or title, like catagories</h5>
          <h6 id="goodWhitespaceh6">Smaller text is usually used to go in depth and get more specific, like subcatagories</h6>
          <h5 id="goodWhitespaceh5">This is another section</h5>
          <h6 id="goodWhitespaceh6">This is another subsection</h6>
          <p id="goodWhitespacep">
            And this is a paragraph in our subsection. We know the title of the page is the most important. This paragraph is not unimportant, but it is generally the most specific.
          </p>
          <h6 id="goodWhitespaceh6">And this is another</h6>
          
          <p id="goodWhitespacep">
            Remember, the smaller you get, the more specic the information is. You can tell by the heriarchy and the whitespace.

    <h2>Color Craziness</h2>

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            Everyone loves colors, because they make things look more colorful! When designing websites, our color palettes can help us establish a brand identity (along with our font and layouts. Thing how facebook is associated with the blue of their logo and uses blue in their website, or how w3schools uses green as their accent and logo color)
          </p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            When using colors, we need to make sure that everything fits together and looks cohesive - this is called color harmony. The examples below are jarring and hard to look at, regardless of use of heirarchy and whitespace.
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-4" id="badColors1">
          <h3>Hello</h3>
          <p style="color:turquoise">This is unpleasing to read!!</p>
          <p style="color:rgb(67, 9, 121)">This is a bit harder but legible on most screens.</p>
          <p style="color:rgb(17, 0, 255)">Bright blue on blueviolet is hard on the eyes :(</p>
          <p style="color:rgb(98, 43, 226)">This is almost impossible to read!!</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4" id="badColors2">
          <h5>Even with a white background you can make things that aren't great.</h5>
          <p style="color:beige">This is hard to read because the text is beige on white</p>
          <h6 style="color:rgb(224, 84, 161)">However, it can have a limited usecase of hiding secrets that you only want visable when a user highlights the text on the page.</h6>
          <p style="color:white">Like this! It's full of secrets</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col-4" id="badColors3">
          <h4>This is another example!</h4>
          <h5>Do you like it better</h5>
          <h6>I think If i read on this colorscheme all day it might give me a headache...</h6>
          <p>some positive points are:</p>
          <li>Does not use tons of colors, only two!</li>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12" id="badColors4">
          <h1 style="font-family: 'Rubik Iso', cursive;">Here are tons of bad color choices all together</h1>
          <p style="font-size: 4px; color: rgb(225, 0, 255);">Lets make a paragraph That is illegible</p>
          <div style="background: rgb(255,0,255);
          background: linear-gradient(90deg, rgba(255,0,255,1) 0%, rgba(255,248,83,1) 27%, rgba(0,246,255,1) 52%, rgba(0,212,255,1) 84%); margin-left: 300px;">
            <p>
              With some fun gradients
            </p>
            <marquee direction="left" height="100px">
              And a marquee to distract us
              </marquee>

              <marquee width="60%" direction="left" height="100px" scrollamount="50" style="color:rgba(255,0,255,50)">
                And an even faster one that fades in to the background color
                </marquee>
          </div>
          <p style="color:chartreuse; padding-left: 200px;">As you can see a bad use of color can destroy a use of whitespace. </p>
          <h3 id="colorGradient">So instead of making something like this, we should use colors that fit together and add to the theme of our website.</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12" id="goodColor">
          <br>
          <h3 style="color:rgb(24, 55, 102)">Don't worry though!</h3>
          <br>
          <p>
            There are many of ways to use color tastefully! Even with a background color!
          </p>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>In this example I'm using a light blue background, then a dark blue for my header. As you can see the colors are a complementary color scheme, and are not distracting. Instead they harmonize with eachother and look calming together.</p>
          <br>
          <hr>
          <br>
          <p>
            I can even use horizontal lines of a slightly contrasting color to make a nice but subtle distinction between chunks of content, like this!
          </p>
          <br>
          <p>
            And I can even use it to create the bottom of my page

    <h2>Image Irritation</h2>

      Images can add a lot to your page! After all, an image <i>is</i> worth one thousand words. Here are some guidelines:

    <div class="container">
      <div class="row">
        <div class="col-12">
          <p>
            It can look jarring to have lots of images of different weights and heights.

          <p> This looks bad! It is better to keep all of the heights the same if we are storing images in a row (like google images), or to keep the widths the same if we are storing in columns (like pinterest).</p>
